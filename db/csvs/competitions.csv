In essence, business design blends design methodologies and business acumen to create a process that helps identify broader opportunities, create new ideas and accelerate market success. Participating in the Rotman Design Challenge is unlike any form of case competition youâ€™ve ever experienced. Learning about design thinking principles is one thing, but being motivated and engaged to actually conduct client interviews, work tirelessly to truly develop relevant insights and bring it all together into a meaningful and thorough business strategy is a completely different game. Putting these principles into practices will significantly change the way you think about problem-solving in the future. In addition to this, the ability to compete against not only top tier business schools, but top tier design schools across North America was especially intriguing. Understanding how they approached such an abstract and interesting problem from a non-traditional client was a significant part of what made the competition so enthralling and engaging.",Toronto,Canada,,,,3,5,Unlimited (initially),Team Applications Due,2017-02-15,Teams Announced,2017-02-17,Case Competition Weekend,2017-04-01,,"Upload the video to YouTube or Vimeo and send us the link at rotmandesignchallenge@rotman.utoronto.ca .
